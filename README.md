# Crafty Lass Project Manager

This non-relational database was created for my milestone project 3 - Back End Development

The live website can be found .....****heruko link*****

The aim was to allow the user to keep track of craft projects started and almost a project to do list

<br><br>

## Crafty Lass Project Manager Overview
***

The home page is bright and colourful, and directs the user into the application. The application will store and allow the user CRUD functionality to organise their craft propjects.

<br><br>

RESPONSIVENESS PLACEHOLDER

<br>

The first page is the landing page, which details the purpose of the Crafty Lass task manager.This page is responsive and image resizes nicely for the desktop and mobiles.

## Project Research 
***
As someone who personally starts many a craft project then puts it down, I would like a way of keeping track of my ideas and have almost a "to-do list" for projects. Many a time I've picked up knitting needles with work half on it and wondered what it was or where I was up to!
That is the inspiration behind the Crafty Lass website. Note - named after myself, not as a website aimed purely at women!

<br><br>

 ### Research Analysis
  ***
Research Analysis
The popularity of crafting and home-based creative projects is booming. Website like Pinterest offer the user the ability to "pin" projects, but these can then get lost in the large number of boards a user can bave. This website is designed to keep track of all these projects in one place, and if you're anything like me, like to start a craft project and then put it down and forget where you're at!
Raverly offers users the ability to save the patterns and print, but not so much for tracking projects.

<br><br>

## User Experience Design
***
* Feedback from users, suggested a home page link was added within the footer to return back. This was to avoid scrolling back up the page, even though these pages were not designed to be long.

<br>

![Screenshots of final homepage design](/taskmanager/static/screenshots/ss1.jpg)
<br>

* This is a screenshot of the final home page with the Get started button. The footer and header both contain some degree of navigation. Highligh 1 shows the nav bar on desktops, highlight shows the nav bar as a burger menu, 3 shows the footer with icon link to home page and the "Helen Arthur" takes users to my LinkedIn page for a bit self promotion!
<br>

![Screenshots of project page design](/taskmanager/static/screenshots/ss2.jpg)
<br>
* This shows the "Add new project" button which redircts you to another page (see below)
* The arrow dropdown allows the user to expand the details of previously started or curent projects.
* The gift icon (Fontawesome) tells the user that they had planned to complete this as a gift.
* The date is the aim of completion date. This can be edited later, but helps the user set goals and gain a sense of achievement.
* The image cards below contain links to some of the most popular craft-inspired website such as Raverly and Pinterest, and take the user to the search term already inputted. For example, the "Easy Sewing patterns" url is the result of searching the term before adding the link to the card.
* Footer and header both visible and links still working
<br>

![Screenshots of Edit Porject page](/taskmanager/static/screenshots/ss3.jpg)
<br>
* This screenshot shows the "Edit task" page where users can alter the Project and save it. It redirects back to the project pages.
<br>

![Screenshots of final New game design](/taskmanager/static/screenshots/ss4.jpg)
<br>
* This screeshot shows the "Add New Project Page" the "Catergories page" and the "Coming Soon" page.
* Within the categories page, the user can add new craft sections and save for updating later.

<br>

## User stories
***
* Users liked the ability to search external sites for project ideas.
* Users found the "gift" slider button userful when adding projects to remind which projects where gift ideas.
* The "deadline" was designed to encourage the completion of the project


<br>

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a First Time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the page
- As a First Time user, I want to add new projects to the page

### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a Returning user, I want to record my projects.
- As a Returning user, I may want to be able to share my projects with external sites.
- As a Returning user, I may want to update the "deadline" dates to prioritise my projects

### Frequent Visitor Goals

- I would like to update my project and mark off when complete.
- I would like to link my saved projects to their source url.
- I would like to be able to see just my knitting projects, or from a specific category.

<br><br>

 ## Features
 ***
 * The user can seek inspiration from the cards displayed on the project (tasks) screen. These have links to external sites such as Pinterest and Ravelry for porject ideas. These all open to the correct url in a new wab for good UX design.
 * 
 ## Existing Features 

<Br>

 * ### Navigation
***
 * The user can either use the burger menu on the side on smaller screens or mobile screens, or on larger desktops and screens, the navigation bar features to the right of the main heading. There is also a logo in the footer which will take the user back to the home page.
  
<br><br>

* ### Future Features
***
* A user log in and authentication function to be added.
* Completed projects section to be added, where completed projects can be stored, for future reference if for example a gift or toy was particularly popular. It could be found again with relative ease, including links to the source url.
* Ability to upload and save images of current and past projects, with completed ones moving to a different database perhaps.
* The ability to share completed porjects with the craft community, either through forums or social media.
* The ability for users to be able to see their projects by category would be a feature that could be added soon after deployment, but have not been able to include due to time constraints/


<br><br>

## Design
***
   * ### Colour Scheme
     I wanted a colour scheme based around the chosen background, which was bright. Complementary colours have been used, greens and purples to catch the eye with bold colouring.
  * ### Typography
    I wanted a simple yet playful looking font, so avoided cursive or handwritting styles. The font used was 'Raleway' from Google Fonts.
  * ### Imagery
    The background imagery was sourced from pexels.com, and from Bing Image creator, using search terms relevant to the type of image I was lookign for. They were all automatically the same size which made it easier to format on the website.
  * ### Layout
    The layout was a very simple design, as its more of a storage and project manager tool than having to be eye-catching and get people attention, as would be the case if this was a marketting page.

<br><br>

## Wireframes
***
I wanted the game to appear the same on all devices, two page wireframes as below for home page

- [Home Page Wireframe](taskmanager/static/wireframes/wf2.jpg)
<br>
* The simple hand drawn wireframe for the website layout. Very similar to the task manager walkthrough from Code Institute

<br>

## Technologies
***
* HTML
	* This project uses HTML as the main language used to complete the structure of the Website. The Gitpod template used was created by Code Institute, and then the IDE used was the CodeAnywhere, with Heroku used to host the project.
* CSS
	* This project uses custom written CSS to style the html.
* Javascript
	* This was based on the task manager walkthrough project as part of the Code Institute learning and adapted.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
	* Font awesome icons are present throughout the website - imported into the base template.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
	* GitHub was the hosting site used to store the source code for the Website and [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is used for the deployment of the live site.
* [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
	* Google chromes built in developer tools are used to inspect page elements and help debug issues with the site layout and test different CSS styles. Allows the testing of features/code without editing of your own HTML/CSS.
* [Krita](https://krita.org/en/)
	* Use to add writing to the book image for "coming soon"
* [MS PAINT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-microsoft-paint-a6b9578c-ed1c-5b09-0699-4ed8115f9aa9)
    * Used to edit some of the images present on the website.
* [Post CSS](https://postcss.org/)
    * I ran my code through this tool to ensure no errors were present and it was recommended to use to fix any errors with Ipad resolutions. 
* [Heroku] (https://heroku.com/)
  * The hosting platform used for the project deployment.

<br>

## Test Strategy 
***

 ### Testing
Testing for this website was done using the built-in Chrome Developer Tools to check responsiveness on different screensizes and general debugging. Testing was also done on an iPhone 10 using Safari and other mobile devices. No issues were found with responsiveness and previous issues have been dealt with through custom screen aspect media queries.

In addition to my own testing, I sent my website link to family and friends and asked for them to test the website out using the same methods listed below. With thanks to Graeme Arthur for peer review and testing.

Home page

* Verify that the images are correctly shown on all browsers and at all breakpoints.
* Verify that the buttons present the user with the correct links and the timer popup. 
* Ensure that the modals display correctly on all screen sizes and can be closed easily by the user to return to the page behind.

Project page
* Verify that the project pages adjust responsively to various devices and screen sizes
* Verify the projects can be updated.
* Verify that the game can be completed and board disabled when game won.
* Verify that timer can be started, paused and reset.


<br><br>

   ### Manual Testing
***
  * Navigation - Repeated steps on all pages.
       * Click on "Get Started!" button takes user to the Current project (or tasks) page.
         * Verify that pages are responsive to screen size and switches accordingly.
         * Side bar navigations direct user to correct pages.
         * Crafty Lass Home link in footer takes user back to landing page.
        <br><br>
    * Crafty Lass Home page
        * Verify that the images are correctly shown on all browsers and at all breakpoints.
        * No modals were used in this project.
        
        <br><br>
      * 
        * Verify that projects can be added on various platforms
        * Verify that projects can be edited on various platforms
        * Verify that categories can be added on various platforms
        * Verify that categories can be edited on various platforms
        <br><br>

  ### Feedback from User Testing
***
  The addition of user log in would be the next step in improving the site. The ability to store completed projects and upload a picture of the completed project would also be useful which is beyond the scope of this project.
   
  <br><br>
        
### Validator Testing 
***
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator]
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator]
<br><br>

### Unfixed Bugs
***
There are no unfixed bugs present within the website. 
<br><br>

## Deployment
***
Once the development was in progress, I deployed to Heroku with automatic updates to test throughout development.

<br><br>

* ### Code
<br>
The html, CSS and Javascript code for game was adapted from the TaskManager tutorial on non-relational databases, using a Code Instiute template (CodeAnywhere) with deployment via Heroku.,and SQLAlchemy.

I referred to W3Schools, YouTube tutorials, Slack, Stack Overflow and peers when I encountered issues, which were primarily to do with layout issues and media queries.
